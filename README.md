# Filament Pics

Hello! I took a bunch of microscope-lens pictures of filament, mainly wanting to see fiber-filled stuff but I took some photos of other materials too. This isn't super scientifically done which is why I'm not gonna write too much about all this, but hey maybe it'll be interesting to you! 

The lens I'm using (Pimoroni microscope lens) for my camera (RPi HQ Cam) isn't super high magnfication, and my light source for this was just my iPhone's LED. I can get a significantly better view with my Shinwa 60-100x magnifier but I can't take pictures with that. But hey, I took my ADHD medication and managed to channel my impulsiveness into spending a couple of hours taking all these pictures with what I have, rather than impulsively buying a new lens for my camera! I have zero income so well done me.

Enjoy!
